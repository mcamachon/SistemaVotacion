These are my dotfiles. To use them clone this repo and run:

    ln -sf <path_to_this_file>/.* /home/$USER/

To get all the vim submodules clone with the --recursive flag or run this after cloning:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

You will also want to have a full color console so run: 

    sudo apt-get install ncurses-term
    echo source <path_to_.bash_profile> >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
